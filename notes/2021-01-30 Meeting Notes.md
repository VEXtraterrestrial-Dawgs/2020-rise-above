# 2021-01-30 Meeting Notes

## Members Present  
Tavas, Athreya, Brad, Sri
  
## Goals  
- Find ways and make a plan to improve driving scores
  
## Driving Notes - Sri and Athreya
- Today we worked on picking up risers smoothly, and also worked on h-driving the robot better and more smoothly. We also worked on the second part of the strategy. This is the part when we get the purple row completed.

## Programming Notes - Tavas

- Today I added a feature to the driver control: when the L-down button is held and the joystick is moved, the drivetrain runs at half speed. 
- This feature is supposed to make small corrections during the driving strategy easier and more precise, hopefully speeding up the driving runs in general.

## Homework  
- Tavas will work on autonomous programming
- Sri and Athreya will practice driving and work on fixing the h-drive

## Plan for Next Meeting  
- Discuss changed to the robot and to the driving strategy
