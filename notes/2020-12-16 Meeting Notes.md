# 2020-12-16 Meeting Notes

## Members Present  
Athreya, Sri

## Goals  
- Athreya and Sri will get some driving practice in.

## Driver Notes - Sri
- Today I worked with Athreya to do some driving practice. 
- We first looked at the robot to see what possible changes we could make in order to drive better. 
- We started out by moving the higher armâ€™s claw down to the lowest point, just like the bottom arm. This allowed the high arm to lift things up straight. 
- A problem that came with that is that now it is impossible to stack three risers on top of each other. 
- We then noticed something odd with the robot. The left wheels seemed to work, but not well. When we tried to drive it in a straight line, it went in a large circle that always turned to the left. 
- At first we thought it was a problem with the motor. We replaced the motor with a different one. 
- Then we realized that the chains on one side were tighter than the other. 
- By that point, we ran out of time, and Sri will fix it during the time in between the meetings.  


## Homework  
- Sri will fix the chains
- Sri will also get some driving practice in

## Plan for Next Meeting  
- Review changes by Tavas to the autonomous program
