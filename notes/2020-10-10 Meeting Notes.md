# 2020-10-10 Meeting Notes

## Members Present  
Athreya, Brad, Sri, Tavas

## Goals  
- Continue building our robots.
- Figure out what roles each of us should have on our team.
- Now that we have built our field, come up with more obstacles the challenge poses and how we plan on fixing them. 

## Meeting Notes  

- Today we discussed the elements of the game challenge this year such as the fact that a lot of the risers start positioned on the ‘ramps’ of the scoring goals, so it will be easy to shove some risers into goals.
- We also discussed what roles each of us should have on our team. We came up with this list:

| Team Member | Primary Role | Secondary Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Athreya | Designer | Driver |
| Brad | Builder | Programmer |
| Sri | Driver | Builder |
| Tavas | Programmer | Designer |

- We also decided that by Wednesday this week, the people working on the arms would give their arms to the people working on the wheelbases, who will test out the wheelbases and arms on the field, and score the robot design. 
- After that, we will mix and match the best parts of each design to create one final design.
- To program a driver control program and autonomous, we have decided to use VexCode IQ 2.0. This option seems like it will be the best in terms of editor, language (c++), and ease of use.

## Problem/Solutions

**Problem:** The first problem that we faced was how to make a good arm design in this year’s challenge.  
**Solution 1:** We saw a Youtube video where someone had a huge claw that would pick the risers up by moving the two beams on the claw outwards to push against the standoffs on the risers and grip the riser. There was also a similar set of beams below it, so the riser wouldn’t tilt forward when lifted and the robot could much easier lift a stack of two risers. However, one downside to this solution is that design had a motor on the claw, which would make it heavy, so the arm would have to be stronger and heavier, and the robot would be very unbalanced. Another downside is that to lift the riser, the robot would have to come at the riser at a 45 degree angle, which means that the robot would run into other risers and goals.  
**Solution 2:** Have a non-motorized claw where there are four vertical beams sticking upwards from the claw. Two should be in the front, these will grip the riser from the inside of the hexagonal beam of the risers.. Two should be in the back, at a V-shaped angle, and these will grip from the outside of the hexagonal beam. This will also prevent the riser from tilting.  
**Solution 3:** Have a longer beam as a claw, which can lift the riser stably from underneath the entire hexagonal beam. This might be hard to fit within the length/width limits, however.

**Problem:** In one set of the orange risers, there are two orange risers with one orange riser stacked in the middle of them. Because there is not much space to get around that stack, one problem we might run into is that picking up or nudging one of the base risers in that stack will topple over the top riser, causing it to fall in an unpredictable location. This is another riser we might run into when driving, and now that it is toppled over, it cannot be stacked on top of another riser.  
**Solution 1:** Push one riser inwards. By pushing one of the risers in the stack slowly inwards, you can convert the pyramid stack of three to a vertical stack of two, and pick up that stack of two and place it onto another riser in a goal, forming a stack of three.  
**Solution 2:** Pull one riser slowly outwards. By pulling one riser in the stack slowly outwards, you can get the top riser to fall so that it is still vertical. This way, you can stack it later.  
**Solution 3:** Don’t worry about it. Getting the two base risers stacked is more important, and taking too long to push inwards or pull outwards will waste precious time.

**Problem:** It takes time to be developing two robots simultaneously, and we want to finalize on one robot design to fully develop and work on.  
**Solution 1 (The Solution we Chose):** Test each of the parts of both the robots and score each part individually by testing it on our field. Once we’re done, mix and match the best parts from each design to create one final robot design. We chose this because this will be quick and will not take many more weeks, and we will not waste any good ideas from either robot design.  
**Solution 2:** Choose one of our robots. We can work on each robot design until we have two fully drivable designs. We will then see which design scores more points on average and choose that robot.  
**Solution 3:** Keep working on both designs. This way, we can continue to make improvements to each design and maybe the design that looks the least capable in the beginning will turn out to be the best.

**Problem:** This year, it will take a lot of time for everybody to be able to do all the roles and skills in robotics as we did last year. This will be hard because, due to the coronavirus, not everyone can drive at the same time, or program at the same time, etc.  
**Solution 1 (The Solution we Chose):** We will split up into different roles. We went around, and it turned out everyone wanted to work on a different aspect of the challenge. So, we now have a table in the Meeting Notes section that shows the roles each of us chose. We chose this solution because it is the most efficient.  
**Solution 2:** Work faster. We can do more of the work independently, and rotate around the field and robot so everyone gets a chance to drive, program, build, and design. We didn’t choose this option because it takes a lot more work and time.  
**Solution 3:** Don’t worry about it. The learning experience is a more important aspect of robotics than being competition ready. We didn’t choose this solution because now that we have all done robotics for one year, we all have the basic skills built up and each of us like doing a certain aspect most.

## Homework  
Figure out how to test and compare our two robot designs and what categories to grade the designs on. The people building the two robots’ wheelbases should also create a simple driver control program so we can test out our robots next meeting.

## Plan for Next Meeting  
Test completed parts and make a pros and cons table and figure out which pieces work better. Then implement those pieces into the main robot.
