# 2020-12-05 Meeting Notes

## Members Present  
Tavas, Athreya, Brad, Sri

## Goals  
- To fix the issues that Sri had found with the robot. 

## Driver Notes - Sri
I found some problems with the robot that I shared with the team.
- the h-drive is slipping quite a lot
- the arms cannot go high enough to stack double risers on top of a single riser
- the battery is starting to drain quickly
- the robot is taller than the height limit (15 inches)

The Solutions:
- h-drive: I cleaned the wheel using a wet cloth, which removed extra dust and debris on the wheels, effectively solving that problem
- the arms themselves will be made longer, which allows the arms to go even higher
- the arms will be mounted lower to the base, allowing the arms to not only be able to stack three risers, but to also be able to fit within the height limit

## Homework  
- Athreya will work on creating an autonomous strategy
- Tavas will start creating the autonomous program


## Plan for Next Meeting  
-Athreya will share his strategy 
-Tavas will show the changes he made
