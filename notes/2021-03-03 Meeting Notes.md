# 2021-03-03 Meeting Notes

## Members Present  
Athreya, Brad, Sri, Tavas

## Goals  
- Discuss robot design sketches and come up with a final robot design

## State Competition

- During the state competition on 2021-02-27, we got an 82 point skills score (79 driving, 3 autonomous) and received the Innovate Award qualifying for the Worlds Competition.
- So, we decided to rebuild the robot in preparation for the competition, and we each made sketches over the past few days on what we want our next robot to look like.

## Sketches and Comments

- Today, we discussed each of the sketches we made and reviewed them.

### Athreya

#### Sketch

#### Comments

- Sri: With this design, weight distribution won’t be a problem due to the riser weight. 
- Tavas: The arm design will be able to grip risers more efficiently and with less fine adjustments, and the arm being mounted at the back of the base will help with weight distribution when lifting a riser. Overall, good design.

### Brad

#### Comments

- Athreya: Weight distribution will help a lot
- Sri: Weight distribution is also something that won’t be a problem with this design.
- Tavas: Arm is well supported, brain placement and arm placement also contribute towards good weight distribution.

### Sri

#### Comments

- Athreya: The plow in the front will help push risers but might get stuck and become a hassle overall good design.
- Tavas: Plow in front will help push risers in, claw will help lift risers. Since the arm is longer than the current arm and the claw will be somewhat heavy, the arm might be hard to lift. No h-drive does save space, overall good design.

### Tavas

#### Comments

- Athreya: Its different than the other designs and I think it will work pretty well
- Brad: Its original but the wheels might make it hard for the robot to move forward
- Sri: Same thing as Brad. 

## Final Design

- After looking at the sketches, we thought about how we could combine the sketches to create our final design. 
- Working to combine the best parts of the sketches we made, we came up with a few things that would be different about our new robot compared to our old robot.

### Arm

- Arm Placement: Middle of robot
- Arm Support: Back of the robot, near left/right wheel motors
- Claw/Hook Design: Motorized claw that grips risers from outside

### Base
- Wheel Placement: Wheels on all four sides of the robot (two on the left, two on the right, one on the front, one on the back)
- Lighter and smaller base

## Homework
- Sri and Brad will coordinate in moving the robot and field to Brad’s house .
- Brad will start building the robot.
- Tavas will start making basic changes to the program.

## Plan for Next Meeting
- Discuss any design and programming changes.
