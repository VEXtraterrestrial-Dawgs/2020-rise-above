# 2020-10-3 Meeting Notes

## Members Present  
Athreya, Brad, Sri, Tavas

## Goals

Work on SnapCAD parts and start getting ready to build the robot physically.


## Meeting Notes

- This meeting was more focused on preparation to build the robot than SnapCAD.
- We started by working on and revising our SnapCAD a little bit more, then realised that working on SnapCAD had a disadvantage, which was that we couldn’t test multiple designs to see which worked best, and choosing sizes was difficult because we couldn’t see exactly how big it was going to be in real space.
- We decided to make a list of parts that we needed and then we divided up the parts we had accordingly.

## Problem/Solutions 

**Problem:** In Tavas’s and Athreya’s robot design, the arms might be too heavy for one motor to lift.  
**Solution 1:** Instead of using a regular four-bar lift for our arms, we can just use one side of the four-bar lift, and have a claw attached to the end. This contraption will be lighter and easier to lift.  
**Solution 2:** Instead of using our current arm design, we can just have one beam as the arm, and a claw attached to the end via corner connectors. Because the risers are relatively lightweight, it shouldn’t be much of a problem to lift the risers with just one beam.
**Solution 3:** Keep the current arm designs we have, and work on making the motor’s power more efficient. We can use gearing to make the arm stronger.

**Final Solution:** All of these solutions seem like they could work, so we will try to prototype each solution and find out which arm performs the best.

## Homework 

Work on building parts of our robot design with the kits we have.

## Plan for Next Meeting

Review what we have done on our parts and continue building our robot.
