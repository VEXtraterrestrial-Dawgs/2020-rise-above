# 2020-11-28 Meeting Notes

## Members Present  
Tavas, Athreya, Brad, Sri

## Meeting Notes  
- Since we still have the problem of the stability of the arm - the arm sways too much to lift a riser - Sri will give the parts to Brad so he can fix the arm.
- We decided today that we would fix the problem by widening the gap between the two 2x8 beams of the base and mounting two identical arms on either side of the 2x8 but one side wonâ€™t have any motors or gears.
- We can add standoffs to connect the two sides and form a four-bar lift.

## Plan for Next Meeting
- We will test out the new arm and start driving.
