# 2021-02-17 Meeting Notes

## Members Present
Athreya, Brad, Sri, Tavas

## Goals
- Discuss the 2021-02-14 competition and make a plan to move forward. 

## Driving Notes

### Competition Scores

| Driver | Score |
| --- | --- |
| Sri | 71 | 
| Athreya | 4 |
| Sri | 39 |

### Problems and Improvements Needed

- During the driving run, we noticed both physical problems with the robot and driving strategy problems.
- Some physical problems we noticed with the robot are:
	- The h-drive slipped a lot and this caused a lot of wasted time moving around the board.
	- When lifting a stack of two risers, the top riser consistently fell off, causing less completed stacks to be scored.
- Driving strategy and execution problems also included:
	- The driving strategy that we used in the competition wasn’t practiced enough, and differed from the driving strategy used in practice.
	- Moving the robot from the purple side to the teal side of the board took too much time in the first round, so we weren’t able to get any risers scored in the teal side.

### Plan for Future

- Sri will test out different things that can make the strategy better, and tell them to Athreya. Once Athreya and Sri decide on a strategy, both will practice driving with that strategy. 
- Tavas will work on fixing the problem with the arm.
	- To make lifting stacks of risers better, we can lift the riser by the top layer of the bottom riser and the middle layer of the top riser. The reason we can’t do this right now is because when we lift the risers like that, the bottom riser angles inwards, making it impossible to stack.
	- To fix this, I will add a beam below the arm to prevent the bottom riser from tilting inwards.
- Brad will come over to Sri’s house to try to help improve the situation of the h-drive. We will try to make some more space to add a second wheel to increase the surface area of the wheels that will touch the floor, hopefully helping the h-drive grip the floor better and slip less.
- Athreya will go practice driving because we really need to work on driving.

## Programming Notes

### Competition Scores

We scored 0 points on all three runs.

### Problems and Improvements Needed

- One of the biggest problems that caused us to score 0 points on all our runs was that not everyone knew how to start the program and which buttons to press and how to align it on the field.
- So, the people starting the autonomous program during the competition weren’t able to align it right and press the right buttons on the robot, and this caused the autonomous runs to get out of alignment at a very early stage in the program.
- So, although we scored high in practice, we weren’t able to score anything in the competition.
- Aside from the lack of communication, we should work on improving the autonomous strategy to score more points.
- Also, the h-drive slipping made the autonomous inconsistent, even in practice. When the h-drive slipped, it would either drive forward too much or too little when it approached risers. So, we should fix this mechanical problem with the robot as well.

### Plan for Future

- Tavas will work on tweaking the autonomous strategy and changing it so that the strategy not only makes one completed stack on each side but instead makes two completed stacks on each side. He will also start the autonomous program during the next competition.

## Homework

- Over the next week, we will all try to give each other daily updates on the state of the robot, driving, and autonomous so we can be more productive between meetings. 
- All of us will work towards our plan for improving driving and autonomous above:
  - Tavas will work on the arm and tweaking the autonomous strategy.
  - Brad will work on the h-drive.
  - Sri will work on driving strategy and practice.
  - Athreya will work on driving strategy and practice.

## Plan for Next Meeting
- Review progress in building and how well the h-drive and arm are working.
- Discuss progress in driving and autonomous scores and ways to improve.
