## Driver Notes - Sri and Athreya

Even though we did not meet up during the week, Sri did some more driving practice, and devised a way to get 75 points.

## Programming Notes - Tavas  	

In running tests today, I found that the turn was still running infinitely, the h-drive wasnâ€™t working, and the drive was overshooting. To debug this and make the necessary fixes, I will coordinate with Sri over the next week

- Sri and Athreya will practice driving

## Plan for Next Meeting  
- Discuss progress in driving, design, and autonomous.
