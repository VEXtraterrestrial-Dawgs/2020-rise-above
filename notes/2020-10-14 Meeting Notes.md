# 2020-10-14 Meeting Notes

## Members Present  
Athreya, Brad, Sri, Tavas

## Goals  
- Finalize on a rubric to test each part out of the ones we created in the past few days.
- Use the rubric to score each robot part.
- Then, figure out how to incorporate all the best parts into one final design.

## Meeting Notes  
- We started by finalizing on a rubric to test each of the parts we built over the past few days.
- We then discussed each robot part, and tested them out on risers and hardwood floor.
- We scored each part and compiled it into a table.

## Our Testing

### Rubric

**Wheelbase Scoring:**  
- Dimensions - Should be as small as possible to save space and increase maneuverability.  
- Weight - Should be lightweight to make it easier to move around.  
- Structural Strength - Everything should be strongly held together, and there should be no sagging or flexing of beams.  
- Gear Ratio - Is the gearing/gear ratio a good fit for the base? Is it the right balance of fast/strong?  
- Brain Position - Is the brain accessible? Are all the ports open? Can a battery be easily removed and inserted?  
- Weight Distribution - Is the weight evenly distributed across the base?  
- Arm Placement - Are there places that arms can be mounted on?  

**Arm Scoring:** 
- Weight: Should be lightweight to make it easier to lift.  
- Strength: Should be able to lift a riser.  
- Mounted Height: How tall would the robot have to be after the arm is mounted in order to stack three risers?  
- Protrusion from Base (at peak): How long does the arm have to protrude from the base?  

**Claw Scoring:**
- Structural Strength: The claw shouldn't flex, bend, or break under the weight of the risers, and shouldn't move around relative to the arm.  
- Weight: The claw should be lightweight to make it easier to lift.  
- Tilt Angle: When the claw lifts a riser, the riser shouldn't tilt at an angle.  
- Strength of Grip: The riser should be firmly in place inside the claw.  
- Ease of Grip: The claw should be easy to position and correctly lift the riser.  
- Protrusion from Arm: How long does the claw have to protrude from the arm?  

### Testing Procedure 
- For each robot part, the designer of the part will start by explaining a bit about the design. 
- Then, we will move through the rubric and score each part.
- For categories that involve measurements, such as dimensions for the wheelbase or mounted height for the arms, we will use a ruler to measure the length in inches.
- For categories that involve risers, such as the tilt angle or strength of grip of the claw, we will pick up the arm, hold it in the correct position, and use our hand to move the arm up and down.
- For categories that involve controlling the robot, such as driving around the base to score gear ratio or controlling the arm to judge strength, we will use the driver control programs that we have programmed in VexCode over the past few days to use the controller to control the part. For pieces not connected to the wheelbase, like the arm or motor powered claw, we will use a wire to connect the motor to the brain and use the standard Driver Control program.

### Results

**Wheelbases:**

| Designer | Dimensions | Weight | Structural Strength | Gear Ratio | Brain Position | Weight Distribution | Arm Placement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tavas | 9.25 x 9 inches | 4.5/5 | 4.5/5 | 4/5 | 4/5 | 4.25/5 | 4.25/5 |
| Brad | 12.5 x 10.75 inches | 3.25/5 | 3.25/5 | 3.75/5 | 4/5 | 4/5 | 3.75/5 |

**Arms:**

| Designer | Weight | Strength | Mounted Height | Protrusion from Base (at peak)  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tavas | 4/5 | 3/5 | 10.5 inches | 9 inches |
| Athreya | 4/5 | 4/5 | 13 inches | 7 inches |
| Sri | 4.25/5 | N/A | N/A | 8 inches |


**Claws:**

| Designer | Structural Strength | Weight | Tilt Angle | Strength of Grip | Ease of Grip | Protrusion from Arm | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tavas | 4/5 | 4/5 | 4.5/5 | 4/5 | 3.75/5 | 4 inches |
| Athreya | 4.5/5 | 5/5 | 2/5 | 2.75/5 | 2.5/5 | 1 inch |
| Sri | 4/5 | 2.5/5 | 3/5 | N/A | 1.75/5 | 6 inches |

*Sri wasn’t able to get his arm in time to Brad so Brad couldn’t test Sri’s arm against the risers. We will update the table next week with the completed results.*

## Homework  
Brainstorm ways to incorporate the best parts we tested into one final design.


## Plan for Next Meeting  
Finish testing our robot parts, and come up with a final design for our robot. Then, start building and programming our final design.
