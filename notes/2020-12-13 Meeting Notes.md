# 2020-12-13 Meeting Notes

## Members Present  
Tavas, Athreya, Brad, Sri

## Goals  
- Finish extending the arm and adjusting it so it can lift and stack risers well.

## Driver Notes - Sri
Today I finished up my work on the arms. I extended the arms by a tiny bit larger in order to get the arms high enough to put the double risers on a single riser. We also had an angle problem when picking up the riser, and solved that by picking up the riser in a different way. Now the bottom arm picks up the riser at a perfectly straight angle. Also, in order to grab the riser the correct way from the bottom arm, I moved the claw down instead of moving the entire arm down. 


## Homework  
- Athreya should get some practice with the robot
- Sri will practice driving with the edited robot and see if the arm works.
- Tavas will continue working on the autonomous program, and will finish the main structure by next Saturday.

## Plan for Next Meeting  
- Discuss how the new arm works and see if we need to make any changes.
