# 2020-09-20 Notes for Robotics

## Members Present
Athreya, Brad, Sri, Tavas

## Goals
Discuss remote robotics tools and set up a plan for the year.

## Meeting Notes
Today we discussed online tools we can use remotely and how we are going to structure our meetings from now on.
- We will be splitting up into two groups to work on two robot designs simultaneously, to save time.
- We will hold video calls as an alternative to in-person meetings.
- We will use SnapCAD to design our robots fully.
- Once we have designs, we will pass around our kits to build the robots.

## Problem/Solutions
**Problem:** This year, due to COVID-19, we won’t be able to meet in person for robotics meetings.  
**Solution:** We learned about a tool called [SnapCAD] which we can use to create our robot designs in detail before starting to build them.
Also, because we have less time to build our robots this year, we will design two robots simultaneously and test and improve on each one
so we can test multiple ideas at once.

**Problem:** We need to collaborate on the notebook and be able to prove to the judges that we wrote the meeting notes the same day of the
meeting and didn’t edit or delete anything later.  
**Solution:** We will use [GitHub].
- GitHub makes collaboration easy, and it's familiar because we used Git last year for our code.
- We can all work safely on the notes without worrying about accidentally deleting something, as it can be restored.
- GitHub can show changes, who made them and when they were made.

We also made a list of conventions and ways we are going to use GitHub in the future:

- We will have one repository for both code and our notebook. This will have three directories:
  1. Notebook pages
  2. Images from our meetings and robot designs
  3. Code for our robot
- We will have a separate notes file for each meeting.
- Each notes file will be named with the date and will have a title inside it that lists the date.
- Notes files should not be changed after the date they were created.
- We will upload images from a meeting to the images directory, and embed them into that meeting’s notes.
- Each image file will be named starting with the date.
- Our main README.md file will have instructions on how to use the repository and a table of contents.
- The README.md file can be changed later to add new entries to the table of contents.

## Homework
Watch videos of this year's challenge and make sketches of robot design ideas.

## Plan for Next Meeting
Discuss sketches for robot design ideas and start to finalize on two designs.
